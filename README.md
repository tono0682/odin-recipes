# odin-recipes
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the learnings acquired from The Odin Project on HTML concepts. 

For this project, I have built a basic recipe website for carbonara. The recipe will be built using basic HTML elements including:
- text headers
- paragraphs
- lists
- links
- images
